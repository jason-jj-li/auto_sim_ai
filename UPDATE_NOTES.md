# Feature Update: AI-Powered Persona Generation

## What's New? 🎉

I've added an **AI-Powered Demographic Extraction** feature that allows you to generate personas by simply pasting text descriptions!

## Quick Summary

### Before
- Manually configure statistical distributions (age, gender, etc.)
- Or upload CSV files with persona data
- Required understanding of distributions

### After ✨
- **Paste any text** describing your target population
- AI automatically extracts demographic information
- Generates personas instantly!

## Example Usage

**Input:**
```
We're studying college students aged 18-24 in California. 
60% female, 40% male, mostly STEM majors. Income $75K-$150K.
They value education, career success, and work-life balance.
```

**AI Extracts:**
- Age range: 18-24
- Gender: 60% female, 40% male
- Occupation: Students (STEM)
- Location: California
- Values: Education, career success, work-life balance

**Result:**
✅ 50 realistic personas matching these demographics!
